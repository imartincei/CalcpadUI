# CalcpadUI
Project for building modular UIs for Calcpad. It will work by allowing UIs to be built using JSON files that are specific for Calcpad. It will integrate with CalcpadS3 and Calcpad.Server to provide the full Calcpad experience for a typical end user who doesn't know how to code.

You can also link to a Coder instance for live editing of .cpd files and .json files. I will add a sample config to this repo for the Coder instance.
